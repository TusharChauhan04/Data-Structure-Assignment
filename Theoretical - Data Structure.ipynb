    "# Data Structure Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >> Data structures are formats for organizing, storing, and processing data, allowing for efficient manipulation and retrieval in programs. They are essential because they help manage data complexity, enhance performance, and enable appropriate handling according to the use case\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >> Mutable types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets), while immutable types cannot (e.g., strings, tuples, integers). Modifying mutable objects affects the original, whereas changes to immutable objects create new instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Lists are mutable and can be modified; tuples are immutable and cannot.\n",
    "> Lists use more memory and are slower; tuples are faster and use less memory.\n",
    "> Lists have more methods; tuples have fewer methods.\n",
    "> Tuples can be used as dictionary keys if all their items are hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   >>Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, using hash tables to quickly look up values by hashing their keys. Each key is hashed to an integer, which determines where its value is stored internally.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "   >> Sets automatically eliminate duplicates and offer faster membership tests due to their hash table structure, making them effective for uniqueness and comparisons, while lists maintain order and allow duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "   >> A string is a sequence of characters, and is immutable, meaning its contents cannot be changed after creation. A list is a sequence of items , and is mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "   >> Tuples are immutable, so their contents cannot be modified, ensuring consistent data throughout a program\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "   >> A hash table is a data structure that stores items by mapping keys to indices using hashes. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Yes, lists can hold elements of any data type (integers, strings, other lists, etc.) in the same list, supporting heterogeneous data collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. WExplain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Strings are immutable to ensure data integrity and enable safe sharing across threads and any modification results in a new string object rather than changing the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Dictionaries allow rapid access to values via keys, provide direct key-value associations,  unlike lists which require sequential search.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.  Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "     >> Tuples are ideal for representing fixed collections of items that should not change, such as coordinates (x, y), configuration settings, or record structures, ensuring immutability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "13.  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Sets do not allow duplicates. When elements are added, any duplicates are automatically discarded, resulting in unique elements only. \n",
    "\n",
    "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> For lists, “in” checks for the presence of a value by scanning all elements. For dictionaries, it checks for the existence of a key using the hash table\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> No, elements of a tuple cannot be modified after creation due to its immutability. This property protects the data from accidental changes\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> A nested dictionary is a dictionary whose values are themselves dictionaries. Use cases include storing hierarchical or complex data, such as student details grouped by class.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Accessing elements by key in a dictionary is average case due to the hash table implementation, making lookups very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "18.  In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Lists are preferred when order matters, when elements need to be accessed by position, or when storing a simple sequence of items without key associations. \n",
    "\n",
    "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Unordered retrieval initially meant no guaranteed sequence when iterating, but lookup time remained efficient due to hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> Lists retrieve elements by position, requiring a sequential search for specific items (O(n)), while dictionaries retrieve items by key, allowing rapid access to associated values. \n",
